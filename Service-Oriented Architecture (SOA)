Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) :-

SOA emerged to address the challenges of large monolithic applications.
It is an architectural style that focuses on loosely coupled software systems and interoperable services.
SOA provides a way to design large systems by dividing them into smaller functions or services. These services are independently developed, deployed, and managed.

Pros:
i) Reusability of services: Services can be reused across different applications.
ii) Better maintainability: Easier to maintain and update individual services.
iii) Higher reliability: Faults in one service are less likely to affect the entire system.
iv)  development: Teams can work on different services simultaneously.

Cons:
i) Complex management: Requires handling communication protocols between services.
ii) High cost: Middleware and additional tools can make it expensive.
iii) Extra development effort: Building and managing services add complexity.
