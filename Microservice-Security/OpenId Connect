Overview
  OpenID Connect (OIDC) is an authentication protocol built on top of OAuth 2.0.

  It allows clients to verify a user's identity and obtain basic profile information via an ID Token.

Key Features
  Provides authentication (OAuth 2.0 mainly handles authorization).

  Issues a new ID Token containing user details.

  Works with OAuth 2.0 flows for secure identity verification.

  Supports Single Sign-On (SSO) across applications.

How It Works
  User Authentication: The user logs in via an Identity Provider (IdP).

  ID Token Issued: After authentication, the IdP sends an ID Token to the client.

  User Info Access: Clients can use the ID Token to retrieve user details.
