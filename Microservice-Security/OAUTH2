OAuth2 Overview

Why Use OAuth2?
  OAuth2 solves the problem of secure authorization without sharing user credentials.

  Under Google, multiple applications provide different services but use a single account (ID & password) for authentication.

Introduction to OAuth2
  Stands for Open Authorization.

  It is free and open-source.

Advantages of OAuth2
  Supports all types of applications (web, mobile, desktop, IoT, etc.).

  Separates authentication logic from the application.

  No need to share credentials (passwords) with third-party apps.

OAuth2 Key Terms (Jargons)
 1) Resource Owner

 2) Client

    The application (website or app) that wants to access the userâ€™s data.

 3) Authorization Server
