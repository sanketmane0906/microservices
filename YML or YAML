YAML stands for Yet Another Markup Language 

It is human redable language.

It can be saved by .yml or .yaml both have same meaning.

spacing matters in YAML because YAML relies on indentation to represent hierarchy and structure. Improper spacing can lead to parsing errors or unintended behavior.

Key Points About Spacing in YAML:
Consistent Indentation:   Indentation must be consistent throughout the file.
                          Spaces are used for indentation (not tabs).


Recommended Indentation:  Typically, 2 spaces per level of hierarchy is recommended.
                          You can use 4 spaces, but stick to one style consistently.


No Tabs Allowed:  YAML does not support tab characters for indentation.
                  Using tabs will result in an error like: found character that cannot start any token.


Spacing Around Colons:  After a colon (:), you must add a space for the value.



example :-

spring:
  application:
    name: myApp

server:
  port: 8080
  context-path: /api
