Configuration management in microservices involves systematically handling the configurations of various services to ensure consistency, security, and scalability across the system. 
In a microservices architecture, each service is typically independent, with its own configurations. 
Managing these configurations effectively is crucial for the smooth operation of the entire system.

Benefits of Effective Configuration Management:

1) Consistency: Ensures that all services operate with the correct configurations, reducing errors and inconsistencies.

2) Simplifies the process of scaling services by allowing configurations to be managed centrally and updated uniformly.

3) Security: Protects sensitive information through secure storage and access controls.

4) Flexibility: Allows for easy updates and changes to configurations without disrupting service operations.

In summary, configuration management in microservices is a critical practice that involves centralizing,
externalizing, and securely managing configuration data to ensure the consistent and secure operation of services within a microservices architecture.
