If you place all your configuration files inside the file system, how will you read them?

Previously, when we stored configuration files inside the Spring project, we specified the path within the project where the files were located.

Similarly, when storing configuration files outside the project (in the file system), we need to specify the correct file path.

The path should start with "file:///", followed by the actual directory where the configuration files are stored. This provides the correct file location for reading the configuration files.

Example configuration for reading from the file system:

cloud:
  config:
    server:
      native:
        search-locations: "file:///F:/config"
