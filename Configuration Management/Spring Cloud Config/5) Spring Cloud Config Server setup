application.yml of configserver project :-

server:
  port: 8071

spring: 
  application:
    name: "configserver" 
    
  profiles:
    active: native

  cloud:
    config:
      server:
        native:
          search-locations: "classpath:/config"


explanation :-

1) profiles.active: native :-
    This sets the active Spring profile to native, meaning the config server will fetch configurations from the local file system or classpath,
    instead of using a remote Git repository (which is the default in Spring Cloud Config Server).
    When running the Config Server, this profile ensures it looks for configuration files stored locally rather than in a Git repository.

 2) cloud.config.server.native.search-locations: "classpath:/config" :-
    This specifies where the configuration files are stored when using the native profile.
    classpath:/config means the configuration files should be loaded from the config folder inside the application's resources directory.
    Instead of pulling configurations from an external Git repo, the server will search for .properties or .yml files inside src/main/resources/config/
