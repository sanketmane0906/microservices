Steps to Add All Profiles of Accounts, Loans, and Card Microservices in Config Server

Step 1: 
        Create the Config Folder
        Inside the src/main/resources/ directory, create a folder named config.
        This folder will store configuration files for different microservices and environments.
Step 2: 
        Add Profiles for Accounts, Loans, and Card Microservices
        Place all configuration profiles related to the Accounts, Loans, and Card microservices inside the config folder.
        Each microservice should have separate files for different environments (e.g., qa, prod).
Step 3: 
        Rename the Profiles Correctly

        The default profile for the Accounts microservice should be renamed as follows:
           i) accounts.yml (Default profile for Accounts)
           ii) accounts-prod.yml (Production profile for Accounts)
           iii) accounts-qa.yml (QA profile for Accounts)
