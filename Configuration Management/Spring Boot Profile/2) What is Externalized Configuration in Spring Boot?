What is Externalized Configuration in Spring Boot?
    Externalized configuration allows you to separate application settings from the application code so that you can modify them without redeploying the application. 
    Spring Boot provides multiple ways to externalize configuration, such as:

      1) application.properties or application.yml (inside src/main/resources/)
      2) Command-line arguments (--server.port=8081)
      3) Environment variables (SPRING_APPLICATION_NAME=myapp)

    If you give the configuration 3 at a time CLI will get higher preference then Enviromental Variable then the application.properties
    CLI> Enviromental variable> application.properties
