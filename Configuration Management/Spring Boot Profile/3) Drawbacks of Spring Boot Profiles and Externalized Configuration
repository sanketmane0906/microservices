Drawbacks of Spring Boot Profiles and Externalized Configuration 


    1. Spring Boot Profile Limitations
            Profiles must be defined inside the application itself, making them difficult to change dynamically.
            Managing multiple profiles across different environments (dev, test, prod) can lead to configuration duplication.
            No centralized controlâ€”each application must manage its own configuration separately.

    2. Externalized Configuration Drawbacks
            Externalized configurations (via application.properties or application.yml) must still be stored locally or in a fixed location.
            Updating configurations requires manual redeployment if stored inside the application.
            Hard to synchronize configuration changes across multiple microservices.
