In this article i have written in detail about next 5 facotrs of 15-factor methodology -

1Ô∏è‚É£ Logs :-
      Applications should treat logs as event streams rather than writing them to a specific file.
      Logs should be sent to stdout (console) so that external tools (like Splunk, ELK, or Datadog) can capture and process them.
      This helps with monitoring, debugging, and troubleshooting in real-time.
      üîπ Example: Instead of writing logs to a file (log.txt), an application should print logs to the console, and a logging system like Kibana can aggregate them.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Disposability :-
      Applications should start fast and shut down gracefully.
      If a service crashes, it should restart quickly without manual intervention.
      Ensures that apps recover from failures automatically.
      üîπ Example: A Dockerized microservice should start in seconds and handle SIGTERM signals properly, so Kubernetes can restart it seamlessly.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Backing Services :-
      Any service the app depends on (like a database, message queue, or caching system) should be treated as an external resource.
      The app should connect to these services using environment variables, not hardcoded values.
      üîπ Example: Instead of storing database credentials in the code, use environment variables:
          DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@db-host:5432/mydb

4Ô∏è‚É£ Environment Parity :-
      Keep all environments (development, staging, production) as identical as possible.
      This reduces bugs caused by differences between environments.
        üîπ Example: If you're using PostgreSQL in production, don't use SQLite in development‚Äîuse Docker to run the same database locally.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Administrative Processes :-
      Any admin task (like database migrations, running cron jobs, or debugging) should be run as one-time processes, not baked into the app.
      These tasks should be triggered manually when needed.
        üîπ Example: Running a database migration command separately:
            python manage.py migrate
