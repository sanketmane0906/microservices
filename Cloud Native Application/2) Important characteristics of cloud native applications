Important characteristics of cloud native applications :-

1) Microservices Architecture – 
                         Applications are built as loosely coupled, small, independent services, each responsible for a specific functionality. This enhances scalability, maintainability, and flexibility.

2) Containerization – 
                         Applications are packaged and deployed in containers (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes), making them lightweight, portable, and platform-independent across different cloud environments.

3) Scalability & Elasticity – 
                         Cloud-native applications can automatically scale up or down based on demand, ensuring efficient resource utilization.

4) DevOps & CI/CD Practices – 
                         Cloud-native apps follow DevOps principles for continuous integration, delivery, and deployment (CI/CD), enabling faster development cycles and automation.

5) Resilience & Fault Tolerance – 
                         These applications are designed to handle failures gracefully, ensuring high availability through redundancy, self-healing mechanisms, and distributed architectures.

6) Cloud-Native Services – 
                         They leverage cloud-native tools and managed services such as databases (e.g., AWS RDS), messaging services (e.g., Kafka), and serverless computing (e.g., AWS Lambda) to improve efficiency and scalability.
